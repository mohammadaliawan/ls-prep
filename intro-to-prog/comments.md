# Comments on the Introduction to Programming Book:

##Chapter 2: Variables:

###Variable Assignment:

The Example 
```
irb :001 > a = 4
=> 4
irb :002 > b = a
=> 4
irb :003 > a = 7
=> 7
```
does not fully or clearly explain the concept.The phrase "This shows that variables point to values in memory" is not very clear. This concept is very important to understand at the beginning. I found the diagram on page 22 in Chris Pines book very good at explaining this point.

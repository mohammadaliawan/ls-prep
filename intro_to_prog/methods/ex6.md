ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product`
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>`

This Error tells me that a method was invoked called `calculate_product` and instead of 2 arguments it was passed only one argument.

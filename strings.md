# Strings

## A String is a list of characters in a specific sequence.

## There are differences in how the single quotes and double quotes strings function.

-Use of double quotes allows the use of 
  - escape sequences or escaped characters
    (Any other character(apart from those in the list) following a backslash is interpreted as the character itself)
  - interpolation

- Use of single quotes 
  - disables interpolation of expressions 
  - disables all escape sequences except single quote (\') and backslash (\\)
